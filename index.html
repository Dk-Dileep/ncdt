    <img src="assets/img/IMG20230707104254.jpg" alt="Image 1">
    <p>I'm the proud student of Professor P.V.G.D Prasad Reddy gaaru. I decided to come into this profession when I saw him for the first time. I would wait outside the room for at least one hour just to push myself into the class and listen to him. It was a great honor for me to share the same blackboard in one of the institutions where he was teaching at that time.</p>
    <p>I considered it as one of the greatest achievements I could ever make. Teaching on the same blackboard where I once dreamt of becoming like him was truly special. Those days are still etched in my memory.</p>
    <p>On a fine day, he advised me, without my knowledge that he was listening to my class on artificial intelligence 20 years ago, to pursue a career in the industry for a great future. However, I expressed my passion for teaching and my desire to continue in this profession. After 22 years, I have no regrets. I am still here, following his footsteps with great honor.</p>

    <h2>PANEL DISCUSSION</h2>
    <h3>Panelists: SaiRam Gaaru, Murthy Gaaru, Ravi Eswarapu Gaaru, Ravi Saripalle Gaaru</h3>
    <p>The panel discussion focused on the question of why research is important. Here are the perspectives shared by the panelists:</p>
    <p><strong>Prof H. Purushotham Gaaru:</strong> Research is a personal journey of education and self-development. It involves finding new solutions to existing problems and is essential for personal growth and understanding the world. All the benefits that society enjoys today in terms of science and technology are a result of research. Research should be considered a fundamental right for all citizens to encourage innovative thinking and better solutions for society.</p>
    <p><strong>Dr. Murthy Gaaru - ISRO:</strong> The world is vast, and knowledge is vast as well. Research is the process of addressing problems, filling gaps in knowledge, or discovering entirely new things. It is a means of exploration and discovery, where researchers act as voyagers, traveling to different parts of the world to gather information and contribute to the existing knowledge pool.</p>
    <p><strong>Dr. Ravi Saripalle Gaaru:</strong> Research allows us to explore the undiscovered parts of the world, which can be seen as different realms of knowledge. Researchers are like travelers who embark on a journey of discovery. They collect information, correct existing knowledge, and share their findings through various channels, such as blogs. Research is an essential process of uncovering new insights.</p>
    <p><strong>Shri. Ravi Eswarapu Gaaru:</strong> Research is not just a process; it is crucial for survival, progress, and success. It is through research that we make advancements, drive progress, and achieve success in various fields.</p>

    <h2>Special Person - Shri Mahesh Rakheja Gaaru, Director</h2>
    <p>During his session, Shri Mahesh Rakheja Gaaru discussed the contrast between the virtual world and the real world. He provided examples to highlight the influence and dynamics of these two worlds:</p>
    <h3>Example 1</h3>
    <p>In the morning, even for just a few seconds, he instinctively checks his phone for notifications and messages, despite knowing that it's unlikely to have any at that time. This behavior reflects the simultaneous existence of two worlds:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The physical world, where people can see and communicate with each other.</li>
        <li>The virtual world, which offers the flexibility to change and control our online presence.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Example 2</h3>
    <p>During his engineering days, he shared a humorous experience where he jokingly posted on Facebook that he had failed two exams. His director questioned him about the failure, assuming it to be true. This incident made him realize that people tend to trust the virtual world more than the real world.</p>
    <h3>Example 3</h3>
    <p>He mentioned the impact of social media on personal perceptions. Changing one's birthdate on Instagram to the following day can result in receiving birthday wishes from others. This highlights how online expressions and content influence how people judge and perceive individuals even before meeting them in person.</p>
    <p>He also addressed the automatic uploading of photos to Google and explained the role of spiders and crawlers in indexing and storing photos. This discussion served as an awareness about protecting our virtual world from potential cybercrime.</p>
    <p>The session concluded with valuable interactions among the special guests and the speaker. Additionally, Shri Mahesh Rakheja Gaaru expressed gratitude for the insightful sessions with senior individuals, Prasanna Kumar, Rameez, Cherishma, Dharani, and his friend Tarun.</p>
